            "description": "This was my first ever internship, and I learned a tremendous amount about software engineering! I was part of the Enterprise Billing team in the Money organization, where I first helped the team recover form a Code Yellow and then built an internal API for our operations team to query all U4B invoices. In the process, I learned how to work with Go, in a monorepo managed with Bazel, and then practiced using React to build my projectâ€™s interface. I also helped the on-call team and worked on documentation.",

During the program, I used the p5.js library to practice my knowledge of Javascript, learned from Google's volunteer instructors and engineers, and attended workshops to learn how to be a successful teammate and engineer. The program ended with a capstone project that I built and presented with my partner, where I used the p5.js library to replicate the arcade game Centipede.",
